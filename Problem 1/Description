You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. 
If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

For example: 
  Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
  Output: "apbqcr"

  Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
  Output: "apbqrs"

  Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
  Output: "apbqcd"
